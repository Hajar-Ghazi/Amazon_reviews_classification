# Amazon_reviews_classification

In this repository, we used the [Amazon Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews) to make a stars classifier for reviews we make a DeepLearning Model that has LSTM in its structure.

In [test](https://github.com/Hajar-Ghazi/Amazon_reviews_classification/blob/main/test.ipynb) notebook we loaded the model and the tokenizer and makes a function that takes a review in the list and applied the tokenizer and padding then pass it to the model to predict the class that review belongs to and then make a threshold to classifies the stars ( how this review is positive or negative)
